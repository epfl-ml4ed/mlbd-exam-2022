    "# Welcome to the MLBD final exam (Spring 2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "The exam questions are contained in this Jupyter Notebook. The `data` folder contains the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The logistical details, rules, and guidelines pertaining to the exam are stated below.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Timeline and Submission\n",
    "**Exam date:** July 6, 2022   \n",
    "**Exam start:** 15h15  \n",
    "**Exam end:** 18h15\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "This exam consists of two parts, a Moodle quiz with conceptual questions and programming exercises in this notebook. **Note that the Moodle quiz with the conceptual questions will be closed by 16h15, therefore please make sure to answer the conceptual questions within the first hour of the exam. To submit this notebook for the coding questions, you should upload it to Moodle (at the latest by 18h15).**\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of issues with Moodle, send your file named as \"SCIPER_Firstname_Lastname.ipynb\" via email to paola.mejia@epfl.ch, subject \"[MLBD] Exam notebook\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You are allowed to use any environment. We recommend using EPFL's Noto environment, accessible through the link: [https://noto.epfl.ch/](https://noto.epfl.ch/). We prepared a Python environment with all the Python packages that you might need for the exam, in the default EPFL's Noto installation. If you want to use some additional packages, feel free to install and use them in a virtual environment. In this case, it is your own responsibility to make sure that your environment is functional and that your results can be properly interpreted for grading. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Please write all your comments in English, and use meaningful variable names in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When asked for plots, please include all the needed decorations: namely title, x/y-axis labels, appropriate x/y-ticks, legend, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. We will grade your notebook as is, which means that only the results showed in your evaluated code cells will be considered. Please be sure to submit a **fully-run and evaluated notebook**. We will not run the notebook for you. Interactive plots, such as those generated using `plotly`, should be **strictly avoided**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. You can use all the online resources (including the code from the demo notebooks from the course) you want except for communication tools (emails, web chats, forums, phone, etc.). Remember, this is not a project assignment. Therefore, no teamwork is allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "We intend this notebook to be completed on EPFL's Noto environment. As in past lecture exercises, you will need to use the `Tensorflow` kernel for the dependencies to be installed appropriately. Change the kernel in the upper right corner of Noto. Select `Tensorflow`.\n"

    "# Question 5 (30 points)\n",
    "The CEO of LernTime decides to further improve the quality of the platform. Specifically, she would like to support struggling students early on by offering them targeted interventions and to also provide advanced tasks to excellent students. She asks you to develop a model that is able to identify the very high and very low performers **early on**, i.e. after the **first 6 weeks** of their interactions with a course. For all courses, advanced tasks should be offered to the top 20% of students, while the bottom 20% of students should benefit from interventions. The overall performance of a student at the end of the course is determined by the final exam score at the end of the course, from 0 to 100 in `exam_score`.\n",

    "Using the dataframe `aggregated_student_df` from the already familiar mathematics course, your data scientist colleagues have already divided the students into three groups based on the procedure described above:\n",

    "1. intervene: students who need help (`exam_score` <= 46.5)\n",
    "2. on-track: students who are on track (`exam_score` > 46.7 and `exam_score` <= 70.5)\n",
    "3. advanced: exceptional students (`exam_score` > 70.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "They provide you the information about the clusters in the `group` column in the `aggregated_student_df` dataframe, as well as the `exam_score` each student obtained at the end of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your tasks are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Implement and evaluate a model (using an LSTM layer) able to predict the *group* (intervene, on-track, advanced) of a student based on his/her performance during the first six weeks (total points on problems obtained each week: `week_0`, `week_1`,  ... `week_5`).\n",
